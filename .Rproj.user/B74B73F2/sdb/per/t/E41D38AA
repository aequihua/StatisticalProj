We are going to run 1000 random samples of size $n=40$. The following code produces the set of 1000 sample means and puts it into the dataframe **Xbardat**:\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE, results='hide',warning=FALSE}\n  lambda=0.2\n  nosim <- 1000\n  n <- 40\n  Xbardat <- data.frame(\n    x = c(apply(matrix(rexp(nosim*n,lambda), \n                       nosim), 1, mean)\n    ),\n    size = factor(rep(c(n), rep(nosim, 1))))\n```\n\n\n#Sample Mean versus Theoretical Mean\nBy definition, if the exponential distribution has $\\lambda = 0.2$, the mean and standard deviation of the population are defined as $\\mu=1/\\lambda=5$, and $\\sigma=1/\\lambda=5$.\n\nAs per the definition of consistent estimators, it is expected that the Sample Mean from the simulation be a good approximate to the population mean. One way to show this property is by calculating the overall mean of the 1000 sample means and compare it to the population mean:\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis',warning=FALSE}\n  XbarMean = mean(Xbardat$x)\n```\n\n* Theoretical mean : `r muexp` \n* Sample mean : `r round(XbarMean,3)` \n\nAs shown above, the sample mean (`XbarMean`) is close enough to the population mean $\\mu=1/\\lambda=1/0.2=5$. \n\nMoreover, an histogram of the 1000 sample means tends to center in the population mean as well:\n```{r, echo=TRUE, results='asis',warning=FALSE}\n  library(ggplot2)\n  g <- ggplot(Xbardat, aes(x = x, fill = size)) + geom_histogram(alpha = .20, binwidth=.3, colour = \"black\", aes(y = ..density..)) \n  g <- g + geom_density(alpha=.2, fill=\"#FF6666\")\n  g <- g + geom_vline(aes(xintercept=muexp),  \n                      color=\"red\", linetype=\"dashed\", size=1)\n  g <- g + ggtitle(\"Sample Mean - Density Chart\")\n  g <- g + labs(x = \"Sample Mean\", y = \"Density\")\n  g + facet_grid(. ~ size)\n```\n\n# Variance of the Sample Mean versus Theoretical Variance\nIt can also be shown that, for the distribution of the sample mean, its standard deviation must converge to $\\sigma /\\sqrt{n} = 5 /\\sqrt{40}$, approximately `r sdexp/sqrt(n)` :\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE, results='asis',warning=FALSE}\n  Xbarsd = sd(Xbardat$x)\n  print(c(\"Pop StdDev / sqrt(n) = \", sdexp/sqrt(n),\" Std Dev of Simulation = \", Xbarsd))\n```\n\nSince the sample size is relatively small (n=40), it is expected that for higher values of n, the histogram will tend to concentrate more to the population mean (that is, the variance of the sample mean distribution will be smaller). Still, as shown in the previous pages, the sample mean for n=40 constitutes a good estimator of the exponential population mean.\n\n# Distribution\nFinally, it is relevant to contrast the actual exponential distribution with the distribution of the sample mean of the same distribution, and demonstrate the validity of the Central Limit Theorem.\n\nAs shown below, for a simulation of 1000 random exponential values of $\\lambda=0.2$, the histogram resembles an exponential curve:\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE, results='asis',warning=FALSE}\n  exps = rexp(nosim,lambda)\n  g <- qplot(x, geom=\"histogram\", binwidth=5, \n        main=\"Exponential random value distribution\", \n        xlab=\"Value of X\", ylab=\"density\",\n        fill=I(\"blue\"), col=I(\"black\"))\n```\nHowever, when shifting to the sample mean as a random variable in itself, it can be found that the density curve is very similar to that of the standard normal curve: \n\nTo simulate this situation:\n\n* Let $X_i$ be a random exponential variable of $\\lambda=0.2$ \n* Remember that $\\mu = E[X_i] = 5$, $Var(X_i) = 25$, SE $\\sqrt{25 / n} = 5 / \\sqrt{n}$\n* Let's take $n=40$ random exponentials, and normalize them by taking their mean, subtracting off 5, and dividing by $5 / \\sqrt{40}$, and repeat this 1000 times.\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE, results='asis',warning=FALSE}\n  cfunc <- function(x, n) sqrt(n) * (mean(x) - muexp) / sdexp\n  XbarNormdat <- data.frame(\n    x = c(apply(matrix(rexp(nosim*n,lambda), \n                       nosim), 1, cfunc, n)\n    ),\n    size = factor(rep(c(n), rep(nosim, 1))))\n  g <- ggplot(XbarNormdat, aes(x = x, fill = size)) + geom_histogram(alpha = .20, binwidth=.3, colour = \"black\", aes(y = ..density..)) \n  g <- g + labs(x = \"Number of simulations\", y = \"Normal Density\")\n  g <- g + ggtitle(\"Sample Mean - Normalized Density\")\n  g <- g + stat_function(fun = dnorm, size = 2) + facet_grid(. ~ size)\n  print(g)\n```\n\n# Conclusion\nThe previous exercises had proven useful to demonstrate the following points:\n\n* For any given population, no matter the distribution, the sample mean and sample variance are good estimators of the population mean and standard deviation.\n* These estimations will become better as the sample sizes (and/or the number of simulations) get larger\n* The sample mean, if n is large enough, can be approximated to a normal distribution centered at the population mean, with a standard deviation equal to $\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}$.\n\n# Appendix\n## Sample Variance versus Theoretical Variance\nIn this section the discussion is no longer around the sample mean, but the sample variance, which is in itself a random variable that has a population mean and a population variance. According to theory, the sample variance is also a consistent estimator of the population variance. If this principle holds, then the mean of the sample variance needs to be approximately equal to the population variance $\\sigma^{2}=(1/\\lambda)^{2}=(1/0.2)^{2}=25$.\n\nIn order to analyze the properties of the sample variance, the first step is to produce a set of 1000 sample variances into the dataframe **Xvardat**:\n```{r, echo=TRUE, results='hide',warning=FALSE}\n  lambda=0.2\n  nosim <- 1000\n  n <- 40\n  Xvardat <- data.frame(\n    x = c(apply(matrix(rexp(nosim*n,lambda), \n                       nosim), 1, var)\n    ),\n    size = factor(rep(c(n), rep(nosim, 1))))\n```\n\nSecondly, a calculation of the mean of the sample variance is compared to the population variance:\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE, results='asis',warning=FALSE}\n  XvarMean = mean(Xvardat$x)\n```\n\n* Theoretical Population Variance : `r sdexp^2` \n* Mean of Sample Variance         : `r round(XvarMean,3)` \n\nAgain, the histogram of the sample variances show that these tend to center to the population variance:\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE, results='asis',warning=FALSE}\n  g <- ggplot(Xvardat, aes(x = x, fill = size)) + geom_histogram(alpha = .20, binwidth=1, colour = \"black\", aes(y = ..density..)) \n  g <- g + geom_density(alpha=.2, fill=\"#FF6666\")\n  g <- g + geom_vline(aes(xintercept=sdexp^2),  \n                      color=\"red\", linetype=\"dashed\", size=1)\n  g <- g + ggtitle(\"Sample Variance - Density Chart\")\n  g <- g + labs(x = \"Sample Variance\", y = \"Density\")\n  g + facet_grid(. ~ size)\n```\n",
